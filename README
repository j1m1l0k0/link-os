This is a hobby project I worked on when I was younger and just
learning to program with C. It is a small operating system kernel
designed to run on older embedded Cisco routers with m68k and PPC
processors.

Warning: the code is unsupported and I haven't touched it in years.
If you have any questions please shoot me an email.
